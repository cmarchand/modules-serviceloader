# ServiceLoader, JPMS and filtering by annotations

This project is a blog entry source code, made to experiment filtering results
of `ServiceProvider` results by metadata owned by annotation on implementation
classes.

Blog is located on [OXiane Blog](https://blog.oxiane.com/), but URL is not yet available.
I'll update this README once article is published.
